*For users looking to install packages it can provide some advantages:*

* Packages can come directly from the library authors.
* Provide the latest versions of libraries.
* Build from source to match your configuration.
* Test your project with in-progress development versions to prepare for
  future releases.

*But there can be disadvantages:*

* Packages are not curated.
* There is no cache of binaries.

Follow this xref:use.adoc[guide] to learn how to use the Barbarian Conan

=== xref:create.adoc[Creating Packages] ➜

--
*For package creators and library authors it can give some positives:*

* Minimal effort package creation.
* Can work with your existing git repo.
* Provide packages that track in-progress development versions.

*But there are negatives:*

* Library authors are responsible for testing the package.
* Which will add to your CI testing time.
* Authors are responsible for responding to user requests of the package.

== Present And Future

The services are in an "Alpha" development state. Although we try and produce
high quality software to provide the services there are bound to be problems.
More important though is that being alpha entails that functionality can
change, for better or worse, as we move towards a full production release.
We will do our best to avoid disruptions, always.

_As for the future, in no particular order.._

* Currently we provide for packages published in link:https://github.com/[GitHub]
  git repositories. But we plan to extend this to other publicly available git
  providers like GitLab and Bitbucket.
* With enough experience we will also look towards adding other Package and
  Dependency Managers to the offering.
* We will, hopefully soon, add a front end web search for the available packages
  (you can use
  link:https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/commands/consumer/search.html[`conan search`]
  as an alternative for now).
* Which will include landing pages for the products and their packages.
* We will be adding an API for others to build upon that will include all
  information about packages, including access/download statistics.
* Make the BSL-1.0 licensed source for the tools and services available for
  contributions.
